# Image Recognition

## Abstract
Image recognition in Python is a popular application of computer vision and deep learning. Python has several libraries and tools that make it easy to build image recognition models, including OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Keras.

## Keywords
Python, OpenCV library, CNNs, object detection

## Introduction
Image recognition, also known as computer vision, is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand and interpret visual information from digital images or videos. It involves developing algorithms and models that can analyze, classify, and recognize objects, patterns, and features within images. Image recognition has become increasingly important and impactful in various domains due to its wide range of applications and benefits.

## Objectives and Goals
1. **Object Classification**: Accurately classify objects within images into predefined categories.
2. **Object Detection**: Locate and identify multiple objects within an image and draw bounding boxes around them.

## Dataset Description
Using YOLO and COCO, the project identifies various objects in videos, such as people in a bus, vehicles in traffic, and utensils on a dining table.

## Performance
Key metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC Curve and AUC
- Mean Average Precision (mAP)

## Result
The success of the image recognition model depends on the quality and quantity of training data, the algorithm used, and hyperparameter tuning.
